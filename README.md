# Walk & Fight Game - [MUEI - APM]
This is a simple game of memorization and mental agility for Android made in Unity, where you need to avoid magic balls thrown by a goblin and use your magic wisely to slow down the attacks and throw your ultimate at the right moment. Be careful, as highlighted magic balls deal double damage. Have fun!

## Implemented Sensors
* **Microphone**: Blow into your microphone to slow down the magic balls.
* **Camera**: Use the camera to see through the game and avoid obstacles while walking.
* **Gyroscope**: Move your device to control your player and avoid the magic balls.
* **Accelerometer**: Shake your mobile when you have enough magic to throw your ultimate ability.

#### IMPORTANT: This game does not work independently, it needs to be compiled as "game.aar" and added to this project https://github.com/DanielV-source/waf in the "app/libs" folder.
